RPG GEAR SET CALCULATOR v0.1

WHAT IS THIS?

Basically a tool to find optimal gear combinations i just wanted to have some calculator that will do all the work for me

if you want to reach spesific stats but dont know what gear/gems/reforges you should go for your optimal build this is for you 

it makes things easier i promise

HOW TO USE

CONFIGURATION TAB

Select your class and subclass

Choose gear level (40/60/80) and weapon level (70/90)

Set how many unique pieces you want (0-6)

Enter minimum stat requirements (Crit, Haste, Mastery, Versatility, Luck)

Click "Calculate Solutions"


MY GEAR TAB (Optional)

Lock gear pieces you already own

Click "Add Gear" to add a piece

Calculator will use your locked gear in all solutions

Stats from locked gear count toward requirements


RESULTS TAB

Browse solutions with Previous/Next buttons

Use filters to find best solutions:

Quick Sort: Sort by specific stats or efficiency

Advanced Filters: Set stat priorities with weights (-10 to +10)


TIPS

Start with locked gear if you have any pieces you must use

Set realistic stat requirements - too high won't find solutions

Use filters to find solutions that maximize your preferred stats

Negative weights minimize unwanted stats (useful for focused builds)


Note: this is not a full work so its ui doesnt look so good i know


THINGS IM CURRENTLY WORKING ON

save options for my gear tab and stat configuration tab

a better gui for seeing gears (like really its just a text file right now)

i would love to have feedbacks
